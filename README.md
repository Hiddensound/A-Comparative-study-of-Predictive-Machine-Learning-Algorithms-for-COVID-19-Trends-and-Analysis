# Machine-Learning
COVID-19 Trend and Analysis 

The project is majorly a comparative study of algorithms on the COVID-19 global real-time data. The core concept utilizes all the principles of prediction in data science and makes use of Supervised machine learning algorithms for time-series forecasting/prediction. The algorithms proposed for this project are as follows:

Decision Tree Induction (Keras/Python)
CNN Regressor (Keras/Python)
LSTM (Keras/Python)
